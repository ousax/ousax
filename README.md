# Hello, everyone ðŸ‘‹

I started my programming journey as a hobby, exploring various languages and building small projects. Over time, my curiosity led me to the fascinating world of cybersecurity. The challenge of finding vulnerabilities and contributing to a safer internet captivated me, and I shifted my focus to bug bounty hunting.
Learning new stuff is the fuel that keeps me going forward.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**:
  - **Python**: Proficient in scripting and automation for security tools and web scraping.
  - **C++**: Experienced in understanding low-level systems and developing performance-critical applications.
  
- **Web Development**:
  - **JavaScript**: Knowledgeable in client-side scripting and exploiting vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
  - **HTML & CSS**: Strong understanding of web technologies, enabling effective assessment of web applications.
